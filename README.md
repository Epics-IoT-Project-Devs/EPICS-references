# EPICS References
A list of resources to refer

## Contribution Guidelines - 
- Any resources you want others to refer, make sure it is in the appropriate folder (e.g. frontend, backend, iot etc)
- If the folder doesn't exist for the topic you are providing reference to, create a folder
- Avoid making redundant folders for topics
- Make the file names descriptive
- Add a one line comment describing the file on top (if applicable)

The above guidelines are to ensure that the references list remains organized, and make referring to them in the future easy for everyone.

## Folder Creation Guide
- You may not find an option to create a folder or upload to an existing folder on github directly. In order to do so, simply name your file `folder_name/file_name.md`.
- If possible, upload any text based files in markdown format (`.md`)
